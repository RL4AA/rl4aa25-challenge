    "# Beam Control 3D Render\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive Jupyter notebook, designed to showcase the simulation and real-time 3D visualization of a particle beam control system. This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for setting up and running the beam control system, visualizing it, and integrating 3D rendering with simulation data. This notebook is designed to help you visualize beam dynamics, adjust control parameters, and observe real-time system changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization is built using WebGL and JavaScript to create an immersive and responsive experience. By the end of this notebook, you will have a fully operational beam control simulation environment, with the ability to visualize and interact with the beam dynamics in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Expect from This Notebook\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore the Setup Process:** Learn how to initialize the simulation environment by importing necessary Python modules, configuring logging, and setting up the project structure. The notebook ensures that the environment is ready for both simulation and visualization tasks.\n",
    "- **Understand the Simulation Loop:** Dive into the core simulation logic, where the beam control environment is stepped through time, processing control actions, updating observations, and computing rewards. Detailed logging provides insights into the simulation's progress.\n",
    "- **Interact with the Visualization System:** Experience real-time 3D visualization of the beamline through a web-based interface. The notebook integrates a WebSocket-based visualization wrapper, allowing dynamic updates of the beam trajectory and particle distribution as control actions are applied.\n",
    "- **Run Simulations Asynchronously:** Learn how to run the simulation in the background without blocking the notebook, enabling you to interact with other cells while the simulation progresses.\n",
    "- **Visualize Results in Real-Time:** Use an embedded iframe to access a web application that displays a 3D visualization of the beamline, complete with a control panel for adjusting magnet strengths and steering angles, and a scatter plot of particle positions."
